        This project undertakes a Black Digital Humanities imperative to consider, and then reconsider, the racialized (and gendered and classed and dis/enabled) structures of information available in archival material, what kinds of questions are implicitly or explicitly available through those archives, and how to engage with and attend to the archive to make questions of race and racialization more available for inquiry. I chose two articles from the Diamondback archives that addressed an instance of Black students taking action against the cheerleading squad for discriminatory practices.</p>
      <p>
        The first article is an anonymously authored op-ed asserting that the Black Student Union is wasting its time and resources supporting the action against the cheerleaders. In my reading, the article was primarily making an assertion of magnitue: some issues are more or less important than others in the struggle for justice. The second article (also anonymously authored) recounted the proceedings from a student court process that litigated the claim to discrimination, and seemed to me to be most interesting for the landscape of claims to truth or reality it laid out from either side of the argument. I found it interesting that there was no information in either case as to the identity of the authors - we do not know their races, genders, positions within the University, connections to the matter in question. As such, I created interpretive categories to try and be able to track how the different authors represented individual and institutional actors (and especially how they represented them in terms of race); how the authors and actors made assertions of magnitude, value; and how different actions or stances were presented as speculative, alleged, and determinant.

        In pursuing this project, I was most concerned with exercising and accounting for my own responsibility as an interlocuter with these archives. I wondered, within the scheme of the TEI header, do I have a responsibility to announce my position as a white, middle class, U.S. American UMD graduate student? I included some of that contextual information, but not others. Beyond just this example, I was most struck by my failures - once I had made a choice about what I wanted to code, I could not completely execute my vision because the TEI codes I had chosen wouldn't nest correctly, or the interpretive categories I created were difficult to map onto the article in any kind of exact way. I found myself within Saidiya Hartman's longing archivist collective when she describes her encounter of trying to recover or repair Venus: "we too emerge from the encounter with a sense of incompleteness and with the recognition that some part of the self is missing as a consequence of this engagement." (2008, 14) But what Hartman models in "Venus in Two Acts," and what I inevitably experienced in this undertaking, is that there is educative and pedagogic value in stumbling through/poking around in the archives (if it is done with care and respect!) because it is a means to spend time, to develop intimicacy with the presences and ghosts haunting what we think we can know.
