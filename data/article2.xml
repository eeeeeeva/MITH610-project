Central Student Court has fin­
ally reached a verdict in the
case of Student Government As­
sociation vs. the cheerleaders.
But the results of last Thurs­
day's decision won’t be released
until early this week, according
to Joseph Metz, faculty member
in charge of CSC.
Defense counsel for the cheer­
leaders closed its case contend­
ing the prosecution “failed to
show discrimination in any
form.’’
"The bulk of the evidence
brought forth by the SGA was
hearsay," charged assistant de­
fense counselor Tom Brown. “It
wouldn’t stand up in a real court
of law,’’
Prosecuting attorney Ron Col­
lier called two black girls who
felt they were
against in the fall of 1967 try­
outs’’ to testify.
One black girl who made the
finals said she felt “both con­
scious and unconscious discrimi­
nation by the cheerleaders."
“We were neglected help by
them,” she said. “We were
forced to practice among our­
selves."
She continued that there was a
feeling among the black girls that
they were “finished before we got
started.” Since so many black
girls felt they were being ignored,
they dropped out, she said.
The defense called to court a
current cheerleader who said she
herself was discouraged when
she first tried out.
She said each cheerleader has
as many as 20 to 30 girls in
her group at tryouts. It’s “im­
possible to devote a lot of time
to one girl. Most girls learn
their cheers by practicing among
themselves," she said.
"I’ve never told any girl that
I would not help her. At times,
however, It is necessary to tell
a girl to wait a minute when
you’re busy elsewhere."
She said she and other cheer­
leaders helped black girls "arm
and arm’’ learning various
cheers.
The cheerleaders themselves
do not select the girls in the
final tryout. Members of the fa­
culty are chosen to be judges,
and they select new cheerleaders.
However, the cheerleaders do
cut girls in the semifinals, selec­
ting which ones go on to the
finals.
In response to the charge that
the cheerleaders practiced both
overt and covert discrimination
at their tryouts, Brown produced
written depositions from girls
who had tried out this year,
attesting to the fact that the
cheerleaders were fair in their
selection process and that girls
were judged on ability alone.
Stanley Pavey, assistant pro­
fessor of psychology, testified
earlier in the c«se that it is
'•a possibility that one can dis­
criminate without really knowing
it.”
Pavey said the cheerleaders
could have inadvertently dis­
criminated againt the blacks.
Brown countered with, "Being
under stress and strain as per­
haps these black girls were, may­
be they construed things that were
normal as being discrimina­
tory."
